/**
 * This test automates the MultipleOwnesrhip gym which demonstrates that RPCs can be sent from multiple actors that have their owner set to
 * a player controller. The test contains 1 Server and 2 Clients.
 *
 * The flow is as follows:
 * - Setup:
 *  - The server spawns 2 MultipleOwnershipPawns and registers them for auto-destroy.
 *  - Every worker sets a reference to the spawned Pawns.
 * - Test:
 *  - Client 1 sends an RPC from both MultipleOwnershipPawns, which should be ignored.
 *  - All workers check that the RPC was correctly ignored.
 *  - The server sets Client 1's PlayerController to possess the first MultipleOnwershipPawn.
 *  - Client 1 sends an RPC from both MultipleOwnershipPawns.
 *  - All workers check that the possessed MultipleOwnershipPawn's RPC was correctly applied, whilst the unpossessed's one was ignored.
 *  - The server sets Client 1's PlayerController to possess the second MultipleOnwershipPawn.
 *  - Client 1 sends an RPC from both MultipleOwnershipPawns.
 *  - All workers check that both RPCs were correctly applied.
 *  - The server sets Client 1's PlayerController to unpossess the MultipleOwnershipPawn;
 *  - Client 1 sends an RPC from both MultipleOwnershipPawns.
 *  - All workers check that both RPCs were correctly applied.
 * - Cleanup
 *  - The MultipleOwnershipPawns are destroyed.
