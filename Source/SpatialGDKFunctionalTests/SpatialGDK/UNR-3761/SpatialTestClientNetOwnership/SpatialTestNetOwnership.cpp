/**
 * This test automates the Client Net Ownership gym which demonstrates that in a zoned environment, setting client net-ownership of an Actor
 * allows server RPCs to be sent correctly. The test runs with the BP_QuadrantZoningSettings and therefore includes 4 servers and 2 client
 * workers. NOTE: This test requires the map it runs in to use the BP_QuadrantZoningSettings or any other setting that creates a zoned
 * environment in order to be relevant.
 *
 * The flow of the test has 2 phases, as follows:
 * - Phase 1 setup:
 *  - Server 1 spawns a NetOwnershipCube.
 *  - All workers set the reference to the spawned NetOwnershipCube.
 *  - The server that is authoritative over the NetOwnershipCube sets its owner to the PlayerController of Client 1.
 *  - The NetOwnershipCube, toghether with Client1's possesed Pawn, is moved by the server that has authority over it to 2 different test
 * locations, such that it changes the authoritative server once.
 *  - Client 1 sends an RPC from the NetOwnershipCube at each test location.
 * - Phase 1 test:
 *  - All workers test that all sent RPCs have been received by the NetOwnershipCube.
 *
 * - Phase 2 setup
 *  - The authoritative server sets the NetOwnershipCube's Owner to null.
 *  - Client 1 sends an RPC from the NetOwnershipCube.
 * - Phase 2 test:
 *  - All workers test that the RPC sent was ignored.
 *
 * - Test Cleanup
 *  - The NetOwnershipCube is destroyed.
