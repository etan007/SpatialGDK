/**
 * This tests whether client connections get cleaned up when a pawn enters and leaves the interest of server that is not authoritative over
 *it.
 *
 * The test includes two server workers and one client worker.
 * The client worker begins with a player controller which unpossesses its default pawn and posses a TestMovementCharacter instead.
 * The test requires interest borders to be in line with the coordinates the pawn is moved to such that -50 is within the interest of server
 *2 and -500 outside of it. The flow is as follows:
 *  - Setup:
 *    - (Refer to above about placing instructions).
 *  - Test:
 *    - Server 1 spawns the pawn inside of server 1's interest but outside server 2's, we verify that we have all client connections present
 *+ 1 for spatial
 *    - Server 2 verifies it has all client connections - 1 + 1 for spatial
 *    - Server 1 moves the pawn to another location still in server 1 but also in server 2's interest, we verify that we have all client
 *connections present + 1 for spatial
 *    - Server 2 verifies that it now has all client connections + 1 for spatial
 *    - Server 1 moves the pawn inside of server 1's interest but again outside server 2's, we verify that we have all client connections
 *present + 1 for spatial
 *	  - Server 2 verifies it has all client connections - 1 + 1 for spatial
 *  - Cleanup:
 *    - The player controller reposseses the default pawn so it's reset for any subsequent test run.
