/**
 * These Tests are meant to test the functionality of RegisterAutoDestroyActor in Test environments.
 * Keep in mind that for it to run correctly you need to run both part 1 and 2, and in that order,
 * since the auto destruction happens at the end of the test, so you need the next test to check
 * that it is working. This test should work both with and without load-balancing, as long as
 * the servers have global interest area (limitation at this time).
